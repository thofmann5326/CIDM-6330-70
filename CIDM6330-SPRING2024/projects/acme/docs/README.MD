# Features

The features of the application should be somewhat clear from the [Acme Airline Scheduling](Acme Airline Scheduling.pdf) document.  The features will be shown using [BDD](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/behavior-driven-development/) and the [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/).
